      <blockquote><h2>What is Accident Notes?</h2></blockquote>
      <div id="answer">Accident Notes is an easy to use mobile application that helps users capture photographic evidence of the time, date, location at the time of an accident; the registration number of the vehicles involved and the damage to the vehicles. Simple forms help the user to make notes such as the name and address of the driver, passengers and witnesses.<br/><br/>
        Accident Notes is an easy to use assistant that helps motorists capture the key details of the accident at the scene for upload for safe-keeping, to forward to their insurance company for initial assessment and to help complete the accident report later in a more comfortable environment.</div><br/><br/>

        <blockquote><h2>Do I need to have mobile phone coverage when using Accident Notes?</h2></blockquote>
        <div id="answer">No. Accident Notes will store your information and send it at the next available moment, once coverage has been restored.</div><br/><br/>

        <blockquote><h2>The other driver may get annoyed if I use a camera at the scene of an accident. What should I do then?</h2></blockquote>
        <div id="answer">It's always better to advise the other driver you're planning to take some photos beforehand. We do not advise doing anything that would threaten your safety.</div><br/><br/>

        <blockquote><h2>What if I am injured and unable to take pictures?</h2></blockquote>
        <div id="answer">Your wellbeing is paramount. However, it might be possible for a companion to help, should time and safety permit.</div><br/><br/>

        <blockquote><h2>How does Accident Notes help the user?</h2></blockquote>
        <div id="answer">Those involved in a road accident are required to capture as much information as possible at the scene: the time, date, location, road and weather conditions; the make, model, registration number and damage to the vehicles, the name and address of drivers, passengers and witnesses.<br/><br/>
          It's common practice for motorists to capture these details at the roadside using pen and paper. Accident Notes turns the content of simple photographic images into contextually meaningful information and reduces the need for the user to capture detailed information at the roadside<br/><br/>
          Geolocation data is used to obtain a positioning fix, and a date and time of the accident. The geolocation data is also used to gather the weather at the time and place of the accident, along with traffic conditions at the time.<br/><br/>
          Automatic number-plate recognition reads the vehicle's number plates and uses DVLA data to confirm the make, model and colour of the vehicle.</div><br/><br/>

          <blockquote><h2>How does Accident Assessor help the insurers?</h2></blockquote>
          <div id="answer">Insurance companies can use Accident Assessor to streamline the front-end of their accident processing workflow, gather as much information as soon as possible and improve their customer service.<br/><br/>
            Information associated with the core Accident Assessor proposition is used to populate a web based accident claim form for those involved in a traffic accident. This web-based form may contain details of the vehicles, drivers and witnesses involved in the accident, the weather and traffic conditions at the time of the accident, a map of the accident and images of the accident ready for the user to edit, complete and approve for the insurance company.<br/><br/>
            A database application facilitates rapid searching of claim data including vehicle make and model, driver and witness names and addresses, insurance details, time, date and location of the accident, weather information and traffic information. Use of the database can help identify accident blackspots, potential fraud, common types of accident and other statistical information in real-time.<br/><br/></div>
